/**
 * <p>
 * A type resolver is responsible for mapping an object of a certain Java class to an object of the DOCX4J api that
 * can be put into the .docx document. Type resolvers are used to replace
 * expressions within the .docx template.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example: if an expression returns a Date object as result, this date object is passed to a DateResolver which
 * creates a org.docx4j.wml.R object (run of text) containing the properly formatted date string.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use your own type resolver, implement this interface and register your implementation by calling
 * DocxStamper.getTypeResolverRegistry().addTypeResolver().
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the object this type resolver is responsible for.
